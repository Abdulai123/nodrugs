            <h2>RESULTS</h2>
            <p>
              Typical programs include between <mark>3 and 6 months treatment, and can
                be up to 12</mark> , depending on the individual's motivation, character
              and degree of addiction. <br />
              Mild to moderate levels of abuse (monthly to weekly) usually
              respond well early in therapy, with sustained abstinence achieved
              up to half a year after initiation. <br />
              In severe cases (daily use, abstinence, aggressive behavior), the
              treatment is usually more long-term, since, in addition to
              pronounced abuse,<br />
              behavioral and personality disorders are observed that do not
              disappear immediately after stopping the use of narcotics or
              medications.

            <p class="motiv">
              <mark> The first and main step to solving the problem is its awareness,
              analyzing the reasons that led to its occurrence and changing
              habits. <br />
              Our therapies include international practices and exchange of
              professional experience, creating a personal therapeutic plan for
              each patient, <br />
              step-by-step transitional drug treatment, detox and sports regime,
              social and work activities.</mark>

            <p>
              The worry and shock is understandable and completely normal for
              any parent who has faced this problem. <br />
              What we would like to share with you is that with an adequate
              approach, appropriate treatment and evaluation of the disease,
              <br />
              the results are satisfactory - more than 93% of the cases refuse
              drug use permanently. <br />
              We emphasize the word "refuse" because there is no other way for a
              person to stop forever.

            Admission includes familiarization with the case, assessment of the
            condition (laboratory tests, status of the organism, 
            completion of informed consent) and consultation with an expert
            (physician) from the team to determine the severity of the
            condition. Since we don't want to mislead you,
            we don't make promises we can't keep, we'd like to inform you that
            we don't help "everyone" because sometimes we just can't. Persons
            who have very severe addictions,
            deteriorating health conditions (long-term use of heroin, abuse of
            various substances, permanent damage to health, multiple relapses)
            should be treated in specialized medical centers.
